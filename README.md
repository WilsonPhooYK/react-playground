### [webgl-interactive-image](https://wilsonphooyk.github.io/react-playground/webgl-interactive-image)
A fun and interactive webGL image based on React that can be interacted with mouse hovering.
The component will breakdown the image into pixels and create a nice liquidfying effect on hover. The pixels will eventually go back to its original position.
